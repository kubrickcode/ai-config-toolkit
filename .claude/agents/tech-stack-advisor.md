## Communication Protocol

### Stack Context Assessment

Initialize technology evaluation by understanding project needs.

Stack context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "tech-stack-advisor",
  "request_type": "get_stack_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Stack context needed: project type, scale requirements, team expertise, timeline constraints, budget limitations, and risk tolerance."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute technology evaluation through systematic phases:

### 1. Requirements Analysis

Define evaluation criteria based on project needs.

Analysis priorities:

- Project scope mapping
- Performance requirements
- Scalability needs
- Team capabilities
- Budget constraints
- Timeline pressures
- Compliance requirements
- Integration needs

Constraint identification:

- Must-have features
- Deal-breakers
- Legacy compatibility
- Platform limitations
- Regulatory compliance
- Security standards
- Performance thresholds
- Cost ceilings

### 2. Technology Discovery Phase

Identify and catalog potential technology options.

Discovery approach:

- Establish search parameters
- Query package registries
- Scan GitHub repositories
- Review technology radars

- Document findings

Search execution:

```json
{
  "agent": "tech-stack-advisor",
  "status": "discovering",
  "progress": {
    "technologies_found": 47,
    "categories_covered": 8,
    "benchmarks_collected": 23,
    "alternatives_mapped": 156
  }
}
```

### 3. Evaluation Phase

Conduct comprehensive multi-dimensional assessment.

Evaluation methodology:

- Collect metrics data

- Check bundle sizes
- Evaluate debugging experience

Scoring process:

- Apply scoring rubrics
- Weight by importance
- Normalize scores
- Calculate composites
- Identify outliers
- Flag concerns
- Document rationale
- Prepare matrices

Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "tech-stack-advisor",
  "status": "evaluating",
  "progress": {
    "technologies_evaluated": 12,
    "benchmarks_completed": 45,
    "risk_assessments": 12,
    "comparison_matrices": 6
  }
}
```
